It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307310916","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/234605/vimperator-3.8.1-fx.xpi?src=api","size":595753,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":144,"totalDownloads":526359,"weeklyDownloads":1558,"dailyUsers":23055,"updateDate":1385313640000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"DarkRevisited@bluewebstudios.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/8/8607-32.png?modified=1344470528","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/8/8607-64.png?modified=1344470528"},"name":"Dark Revisited","type":"theme","version":"4.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Mateo1041","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mateo1041/?src=api"},"description":"A more balanced dark theme.","fullDescription":"I've enjoyed working on this theme, but unfortunately no longer have time to make updates, especially with the frequent updates to Firefox.

Arrange tiles horizontally, vertically or in a grid. Resize tiles by dragging splitter bars. Tabs and links can be dragged to open in other tiles. Supports multiple tiled layouts. Works with tab groups.","fullDescription":"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMULTIPLE TILED LAYOUTS CAN BE SAVED AS A 'MULTI-LAYOUT'\nTILED LAYOUTS CAN BE IMPORTED AND EXPORTED\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTile Tabs allows tabs to be displayed in tiled layouts within the Firefox tabbed browser content area. In each tiled layout, tiles can be arranged horizontally, vertically or in a grid, and tiles can be re-sized by dragging splitter bars. Tabs and links can be dragged to open in new or existing tiles. The scrolling of tiles can be synchronized. A tiled layout can display tabs from more than one Firefox tab group.\n\nThe Firefox tabbed browser paradigm is fully maintained. Tiled layouts are achieved by presentational changes rather than functional changes. All features (menu commands, url bar, search bar, tabs buttons) continue to operate as normal.\n\nLayouts can be created and tabs can be tiled individually above, below, left or right of the active tile. Tiles are arranged in groups - where all the tiles in a group have the same width or same height - and all the tiles in a group are separated by splitters all with the same orientation (horizontal or vertical). Tiles can be displayed with a tab button for each tile - or with a single tab button for each layout.\n\nIndividual layouts can be saved, opened, deleted or set as the default layout. In addition, all of the currently open layouts can be saved as a single Multi-Layout.\n\nTiling is performed using Menu Commands, Keyboard Shortcuts or Drag-and-Drop of tabs and links.\n\nThe major features of the Tile Tabs user interface are illustrated in the above screenshots.\n\nUsers migrating from Tile View, please refer to the Notes for Tile View Users section below.\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nTo get started, create a default layout by clicking on the Tile Tabs button.\n\nAlternatively, try tiling two specific tabs using menu commands:\n\n    • Select the first tab to be tiled by clicking on its tab button.\n    • Click Tile on the main menu bar or app menu.\n    • Select Tile Tab on the sub-menu.\n    • Select the direction - Above, Left, Right or Below.\n    • Select the second tab to be tiled.\n\nClose all layouts by double-clicking on the Tile Tabs button.\n\nTHINGS TO TRY\n\nDrag-and-Drop tiling of tabs - to make tiling quicker - just Shift+Drag a tab or link:\n\n    • For further details see the Drag-to-Tile Shortcut section below.\n\nAutomatic assignment of tabs - for a different browsing experience - enable these options:\n\n    • Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected\n    • Assign another tab when tiled tab closed\n\nLATEST UPDATES\n\nThe important changes in Tile Tabs 10.2 are:\n\n    • All layouts that are currently open can now be saved as a single Multi-Layout.\n    • Opening a Multi-Layout opens all of the individual layouts saved in the Multi-Layout.\n    • New option to configure which key (Shift/Ctrl/Alt) is held down to stop automatic activation of tile.\n\n    • Save Layout dialog now has option to save all open layouts as a Multi-Layout.\n    • Manage Layouts dialogs now have Multi column showing number of layouts in a Multi-Layout.\n    • Recent Layout list can now contain up to 20 recently used layout names\n\n    • Fixed problem in Configure Layout dialog which did not display the currently selected layout colour.\n\nThe important changes in Tile Tabs 10.3 are:\n\n    • Updated to be compatible with Firefox 25.*.\n\nThe important changes in Tile Tabs 10.4 are:\n\n    • New Import Layouts command to import one or more layouts from a text file.\n    • New Export Layouts command to export one or more layouts into a text file.\n\nPlease see Release Notes for further details.\n\nUSER REFERENCE\n\nTiles and Splitters\n\nA tile can be made the active tile by clicking on the corresponding tab button or by clicking on the tile's contents. A tiled tab is indicated by a colored border around the tab button icon. The active tile is indicated by a colored border around the tile contents. The highlighting of tiled tabs can be changed to use colored text and/or italic text on the tab buttons. A different tab can be displayed in the active tile by doing Shift+Click on the tab button.\n\nA tile can be re-sized by dragging the adjacent splitter bars. Splitter bars will snap into position when near to the edge of a tile or another splitter bar. Double-click on any splitter to equalize the size of all the tiles in that group.\n\nTab Selection\n\nA tab is selected by clicking on the tab button in the tabs bar. By default, when in tiled view, selecting a tiled tab displays the tiled layout, and selecting an untiled tab displays the tab normally. Alternatively, there is an option (Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected) to always display the tiled layout when in tiled view. This option automatically assigns the selected tab to the active tile, if the selected tab was previously untiled.\n\nThe way that tab selection works can be temporarily changed using the Click Assign Tab shortcut (see below).\n\nThe tooltips for tiled tab buttons show both the layout name and the web page URL.\n\nLayout Commands\n\nThere are four layout commands which appear on the main menus:\n\n    • New Layout - creates a pre-defined layout with two, three, four or all tabs or using the default layout.\n    • Recent Layout - quickly opens a recently used layout and assigns saved tabs (if any) to tiles.\n    • Close Layout - closes the the active layout and all assigned tabs revert to normal operation.\n    • Close All Layouts - closes all layouts all assigned tabs revert to normal operation.\n\nand seven more layout commands which appear on the Manage Layouts submenu:\n\n    • Open Layout - opens a previously saved layout and assigns saved tabs (if any) to tiles.\n    • Save Layout - saves the active layout and optionally the assigned tabs, pinned states, scroll/tab locks and layout color.\n    • Delete Layouts - deletes previously saved layouts (multiple layouts can be selected).\n    • Configure Layout - configures the name and color of the active layout.\n    • Set Default Layout - sets the default layout to be used by the toolbar button and on start-up.\n    • Import Layouts - imports previously exported layouts from a text file.\n    • Export Layouts - exports previously saved layouts to a text file (multiple layouts can be selected).\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the Tile menu on the main menu bar or app menu, or from the Tile View button menu on the toolbar.\n\nThe New Layout command always assigns the currently selected tab to top-left tile in the layout, and automatically creates and assigns new blank tabs to the other new tiles. The All Tabs submenu items create a layout containing all of the previously untiled tabs. There are options to assign existing tabs to new tiles in preference to creating new tabs, and to load the homepage into new tabs.\n\nThe Open Layout and Recent Layout commands reinstate tiled tab pinned states and scroll/tab locks (if any). The Open Layout and Recent Layout commands can also be used to open a Multi-Layout, which opens all of the individual layouts saved in the Multi-Layout.\n\nThe Close Layout and Close All Layouts commands automatically close any blank tabs created by New Layout that have not been used (still either blank or showing the homepage). There is an option to also automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n\nThe Save Layout command requires a layout name which cannot be null and can only contain letters, digits, underscores, hyphens and spaces. There are checkboxes to save tabs, save pinned states, save scroll/tab locks and to save the layout color. The Save Layout command also has a checkbox to save all of the currently open layouts as a single Multi-Layout.\n\nThe Set Default Layout command sets the default layout as a layout with two tabs or all tabs, or as a previously saved layout. This allows the default layout to be set to any layout that can be created using the New Layout command or tiling commands.\n\nTiling Commands\n\nThere are eight tiling commands which appear on both the main menus and on the context menus:\n\n    • Tile Tab - adds an existing tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Tile New Tab - opens a new tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Tile Duplicate Tab - opens a duplicate tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Tile Link in New Tab - opens a link in a new tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Assign Tab - replaces the tab displayed in the currently active tile with another (tiled or untiled) tab.\n    • Untile Tab - removes a tile and the assigned tab reverts to normal operation.\n    • Expand Tile - expands a tile and collapses all the other tiles in that group.\n    • Show Properties - shows a popup with the tab title and tab group for the active tile (see Properties Popups section).\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the Tile menu on the main menu bar or app menu, or from the Tile Tabs button menu on the toolbar, or from the context menus after right-clicking on a tab or a tile's contents.\n\nThe Assign Tab command assigns a different tab to be displayed in the active tile. If the chosen tab is already tiled in another tile (possibly in another layout), then the existing tab in the active tile and the chosen tab are interchanged.\n\nThe Untile Tab command automatically closes the assigned tab if it was a blank tab created by New Layout and has not been used (still either blank or showing the homepage). There is an option to also automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n\nThe Expand Tile command can be used repeatedly on the same tile to alternately expand the tile horizontally and vertically - and when the tile is already fully expanded to reinstate the original layout and tile dimensions.\n\nMode Switches\n\nThere are two mode switches which appear on the main menus:\n\n    • View Tiled - toggles between the tiled layout view and the normal browser view.\n    • Sync Scroll - toggles synchronized scrolling of tiles on or off.\n\nThese switches can be can be toggled from the Tile menu on the main menu bar or appmenu, or from the Tile Tabs button menu on the toolbar.\n\nSync Scroll (when ticked) synchronizes horizontal and vertical scrolling within each group of tiles. It allows easy comparison of two or more similar web pages. Any initial scrolling offset between the contents of the tiles in a group is maintained. There is an option to synchronize scrolling only when the mouse is over the active tile.\n\nView Tiled (when not ticked) shows the normal browser view with every tab displayed at at full size. It allows normal browsing in any of the tabs without closing the tiled layouts.\n\nSplitter Commands\n\nThere are five splitter commands, three of which allow tiling adjacent to an existing group of tiles:\n\n    • Tile Tab - adds an existing tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    • Tile New Tab - opens a new tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    • Tile Duplicate Tab - opens a duplicate tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    • Equalize Group - equalizes the size of all the tiles in the highlighted group.\n    • Equalize All - equalizes the size of all the tiles in all of the groups.\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the context menu after right-clicking on a horizontal or vertical splitter bar.\n\nThe highlighted group of tiles is indicated by a dashed colored border around each of the tiles in the group.\n\nToolbar Button\n\nThe Tile Tabs button can be added to the toolbar by right-clicking the toolbar, selecting Customize..., and dragging the button onto the toolbar. The Tile Tabs button is automatically added to the toolbar on initial installation.\n\nThe Tile Tabs button can invoke immediate actions (by clicking on the icon) or display a drop-down menu (by clicking on the down arrow).\n\nClicking on the Tile Tabs button creates a default layout if there is no existing layout, and thereafter switches between the tiled view and the normal browser view.\n\nMiddle-clicking on the Tile Tabs button either creates a new default layout or closes the active layout.\n\nDouble-clicking on the Tile Tabs button closes all layouts.\n\nThere are options to re-configure all of the Tile Tabs button actions.\n\nProperties Popups\n\nA properties popup can be shown for the active tile using the Show Properties command. A properties popup displays the tab title and tab group name for the tab assigned to the underlying tile. Clicking on the main body of a properties popup will make the underlying tile active.\n\nA properties popup also displays three buttons:\n\n    • Assign Tab - assigns a different tab to the underlying tile.\n    • Scroll Lock - prevents the contents of a tile being scrolled.\n    • Tab Lock - prevents the tab assigned to a tile being changed.\n\nWhen a scroll lock or tab lock is infringed, a properties popup appears with the relevant lock button highlighted in red.\n\nThere are options to automatically show properties popups when the mouse enters the active and inactive tiles, and to automatically fade out the display of properties popups after a few seconds. There is also an option to change the width of the properties popups.\n\nWorking With Tab Groups\n\nTile Tabs is fully integrated with Firefox's tab group (Panorama) functionality. Tiled layouts can contain tabs from more than one tab group, but may be restricted to tabs from the current tab group. However, this restriction will be ignored when tabs are moved between tab groups in the Panorama window.\n\nThe tab lists in the Tile Tab and Assign Tab commands show all tabs in all tab groups. The tabs in the current tab group are shown at the top of the list above the first menu separator. The tabs in other tab groups are shown further down the tab list, with each tab group delimited by a menu separator. There is an option for tab lists to only show the tabs in the current tab group.\n\nA tab in a tiled layout that is not in the current tab group will be indicated by a dotted colored border around the tile contents.\n\nAutomatically Activating Tiles\n\nThere is an option to allow tiles to be automatically activated when the mouse enters (moves over) a tile.\n\nIt is still possible to move the mouse over other tiles without changing the active tile by holding down a configurable modifier key (Shift, Ctrl or Alt). This is useful when accessing the Tile menu on the main menu bar or app menu, or when accessing the Tile Tabs button on the toolbar, or when the Sync Scroll with wheel only when mouse over active tile option is enabled.\n\nRenaming Tabs With Layout Name\n\nThere is an option to rename all of the tiled tabs in a layout with the layout name. The layout name can be changed using the Configure Layout command.\n\nShrink-to-Fit Zoom\n\nA Shrink-to-Fit zoom feature is provided both for individual tiled tabs and for all tiled tabs in a layout.\n\nThere are four control key shortcuts:\n\n    • Ctrl + < - shrinks the web page in the selected tiled tab to fit the tile width\n    • Ctrl + < twice - shrinks the web pages in all tiled tabs in the active layout to fit the tile widths\n\n    • Ctrl + > - resets the zoom level for the selected tiled tab to the default zoom level\n    • Ctrl + > twice - resets the zoom level for all tiled tabs in the active layout to the default zoom level\n\nFunction Key Shortcuts\n\nThere are six function key shortcuts:\n\n    • New/Close Layout - F12\n    • Untile Tab - F4\n    • Expand Tile - F2\n    • Show Properties - F1\n    • Sync Scroll - F8\n    • View Tiled - F9\n\nEach function key shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus a function key (F1-F12) - or can be disabled.\n\nArrow Key Shortcuts\n\nThere are three arrow key shortcuts:\n\n    • Tile New Tab - Shift+ArrowKey\n    • Tile Duplicate Tab - Ctrl+ArrowKey\n    • Activate Tile - Ctrl+Shift+ArrowKey\n\nEach arrow key shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus an arrow key - or can be disabled. These shortcuts work even if there is no existing layout. There is an option to disable these arrow key shortcuts when the keyboard focus is in a text box.\n\nMouse Shortcuts\n\nNew/Close Layout - Double-click tab\n\nDouble-click on a tab to create new layout (if tab untiled) or close layout (if tab tiled).\n\nCopy Tab/Link - Drag tab/link\n\nCtrl+Drag a tab or link onto an existing tile's contents to open the tab's or link's URL in the existing tile. A link can be a hyperlink on a web page or a bookmark link or a history link. A new tab is not created.\n\nThe drag-to-copy shortcut is a standard Firefox shortcut and cannot be changed.\n\nTile Tab/Link - Shift+Drag tab/link\n\nShift+Drag a tab or link onto an existing tile's contents to open the tab's or link's URL in a new tile above, left, right or below the existing tile. A label beside the cursor indicates the direction in which the tab or link will be tiled when it is dropped. The direction is determined by the position of the cursor within the existing tile (e.g. if the cursor is near the top, then the new tile will be created above). A new tab is created except when an untiled tab is dragged.\n\nTo create the first two tiles of a layout, Shift+Drag a tab or link onto the currently selected (untiled) tab's contents.\n\nIt is not allowed to Shift+Drag a tab or link onto a tiled tab when in normal browser view, and a label beside the cursor indicates that the operation is invalid.\n\nThe drag-to-tile shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus dragging a tab or link - or can be disabled. This shortcut works even if there is no existing layout.\n\nAssign Tab - Shift+Click tab\n\nShift+Click on a tab to assign (or not assign) the tab to the active tile. If clicking the tab would just have selected the tab, then Shift+Click on the tab will assign the tab to the active tile. Conversely, if clicking the tab would have assigned the tab to the active tile, then Shift+Click on the tab will just select the tab.\n\nShift+Click on a properties popup to assign the tab in the underlying tile to the active tile.\n\nThe click-to-assign shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus clicking on a tab - or can be disabled.\n\nOpen In Next Tile - Ctrl+Middle-click link\n\nCtrl+Middle-click on a link in a tiled tab to open the link in the \"next\" tile in the group (to the right or below). If the next tile to the right or below contains sub-tiles, then the link will be opened in the topmost leftmost sub-tile. If the clicked link is in the last tile of the group, then the link will be opened in the first tab of the group.\n\nThe open-in-next-tile shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus middle-clicking on a link - or can be disabled. There is an option to open the link in a new tab rather than loading in the existing tab.\n\nOpen In Prev Tile - Ctrl+Shift+Middle-click link\n\nCtrl+Shift+Middle-click on a link in a tiled tab to open the link in the \"previous\" tile in the group (to the left or above). If the previous tile to the left or above contains sub-tiles, then the link will be opened in the topmost leftmost sub-tile. If the clicked link is in the first tile of the group, then the link will be opened in the last tab of the group.\n\nThe open-in-prev-tile shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus middle-clicking on a link - or can be disabled. There is an option to open the link in a new tab rather than loading in the existing tab.\n\nStart-up and Restart\n\nTile Tabs can be configured to restore the layouts from a previous session when Firefox starts-up or restarts. After a restart, it should always be possible to restore the layouts. However, on start-up it is only possible to restore the layouts if the tabs from the previous session have been saved, which requires the Firefox option When Firefox starts: to be set to Show my windows and tabs from last time.\n\nTile Tabs can also be configured to apply the default layout when Firefox starts-up or restarts. The default layout is not applied if session restore is configured and possible.\n\nNotes For Tile View Users\n\nTo make Tile Tabs work in the same way as Tile View, three options must be enabled:\n\n    • Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected\n    • Assign to active tile when tiled tab selected\n    • Assign another tab when tiled tab closed\n\nOptions\n\nThe Options Dialog can be accessed from the Firefox Add-ons Manager or by selecting Options ... on the Tile menu or on the Tile Tabs toolbar button menu.\n\nThe Options Dialog allows the user to:\n\n    • Select a set of eight colors for multiple tiled layouts.\n    • Change the width of the colored border around the active tile.\n    • Automatically activate tile when mouse enters tile.\n    • Change the key that stops automatic activation of tiles.\n    • Syncronize Scroll with wheel only when the mouse is over the active tile.\n    • Change the width of the properties popup.\n    • Automatically show Properties popup when mouse enters the active and inactive tiles.\n    • Automatically fade out the display of Properties popup after a few seconds.\n    • Not to show the Tab Group name in Properties popups.\n    • Change the size of the splitters.\n    • Change the snap distance for splitters.\n    • Change the highlighting of tiled tabs (show icon, color text or italic text).\n    • Display a single tab for each layout (instead of a tab for each tile).\n    • Move all tiled tabs to left-hand side of tab bar.\n    • Rename tiled tabs with their layout name.\n    • Assign untiled tab to active tile when selected.\n    • Assign tiled tab to active tile when selected.\n    • Assign another tab when tiled tab closed.\n    • Assign existing tabs to tiles in preference to creating new tabs.\n    • Assign existing tabs from right of selected/closed tab (instead of left).\n    • Load new tabs with home page.\n    • Keep selected tab when switching to tiled view.\n    • Create new tabs to fill the last row/column of a new grid.\n    • Automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n    • Show the Tile menu on the main menu bar and app menu.\n    • Only show tabs in the current tab group in tab lists.\n    • Show the Tile submenu on the tab context menu.\n    • Choose the menu items shown on the tab context menu.\n    • Show the Tile submenu on the content context menu.\n    • Choose the menu items shown on the content context menu.\n    • Change the function key shortcuts (new/close layout, untile tab, expand tile, show properties, sync scroll, view tiled).\n    • Change the arrow key shortcuts (tile new tab, tile duplicate tab, activate tile).\n    • Disable the arrow key shortcuts if keyboard focus is in a text box.\n    • Change the mouse shortcuts (new/close layout, drag-to-tile, click-to-assign, open-in-next-tile, open-in-prev-tile).\n    • Choose whether Open In Next Tile and Open In Prev Tile open link in a new tab.\n    • Choose the commands to be performed for each of the Tile Tabs button actions (click, middle-click, double-click).\n    • Restore the layout from a previous session on start-up and after restart.\n    • Apply the default layout on start-up and after restart.\n\nThe Restore Defaults button restores all options to their original default setting.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/71/71506.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/71/71506.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"A tiled layout with six tiles."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/71/71507.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/71/71507.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Tiled tabs are indicated by blue borders around the tab button icons.

Using interactive visualizations, Lightbeam shows you the relationships between these third parties and the sites you visit.","fullDescription":"About this Add-on\nUsing interactive visualizations, Lightbeam enables you to see the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web. As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user. Using three distinct interactive graphic representations — Graph, Clock and List — Lightbeam enables you to examine individual third parties over time and space, identify where they connect to your online activity and provides ways for you to engage with this unique view of the Web.\n\nHow Lightbeam Works\nWhen you activate Lightbeam and visit a website, sometimes called the first party, the add-on creates a real time visualization of all the third parties that are active on that page. The default visualization is called the Graph view. As you then browse to a second site, the add-on highlights the third parties that are also active there and shows which third parties have seen you at both sites. The visualization grows with every site you visit and every request made from your browser. In addition to the Graph view, you can also see your data in a Clock view to examine connections over a 24-hour period or in a List view to drill down into individual sites.\n\nHow You Can Use Lightbeam to Help Us Illuminate the Inner Workings of the Web\nAs a part of Lightbeam, we're creating a big-picture view of how tracking works on the Internet, and how third-party sites are connected to multiple other sites. You may contribute your data to our crowdsourced directory by simply turning on the share switch within the add-on. To disable crowdsourcing, you can turn it off at any time. You can view your local data stored within Lightbeam at any time, or save your data by clicking the \"Save\" button under the data section on the left side of the add-on.\n\nHow is my information stored?\nAs a default, all info generated and used for Lightbeam’s visualizations and features are only stored locally on your computer. You can save a copy of your connection history at any time, which is also where you can see the specific data collected by the add-on. You may also reset Lightbeam to erase your locally stored connection history, disable it to stop data collection or uninstall it to instantly remove all locally stored data related to Lightbeam. Additional information related to Lightbeam’s file format is available here\n\nThe origins of Lightbeam\nLightbeam began in July 2011 as Collusion, a personal project by Mozilla software developer Atul Varma. Inspired by the book The Filter Bubble, Atul created an experimental add-on to visualize browsing behavior and data collection on the Web.\n\nIn February 2012, Gary Kovacs, Mozilla CEO at the time, introduced the Collusion add-on in a TED talk (now one of the most watched TED talks) about exposing online tracking.\n\nIn September 2012, Mozilla joined forces with students at Emily Carr University of Art + Design to develop and implement visualizations for the add-on. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Collusion has been re-imagined as Lightbeam and was launched in the fall of 2013.\n\nTo read more about the collaboration, please visit http://www.simcentre.ca\n\nFeedback\nYour input is valuable to us, so don’t forget to rate, review or give us feedback after using Lightbeam.

If you often use many many tabs, it will help your web browsing because you can understand relations of tabs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* You can collapse/expand sub trees. It is convenient for too many tabs.\n* When you close a tab which has collapsed sub tree, all of tabs in the sub tree will be closed only one action.\n* The tree of tabs can be showin at rightside.\n* Vertical tab bar cab be shown/hidden automatically.\n* You can open new tab between existing tabs, dropping link or URL string there.\n* You can save/restore the tree of tabs over sessions, by Session Manager ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2324 ) or other session-management addons.\n* Drag and drop is available to modify relations of tabs and to rearrange. The behavior seems to be like \"layer tree \" of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n* Tab bar can be moved to leftside, rightside, top, or bottom. Horizontal tree is also available.\n* This has an API for extension authors to open child tabs for existing tabs. (See also http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en#api )\n\nThis is developed under a project to restructure TBE ( http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/tabextension/index.html.en ) for Firefox 2. Multiple Tab Handler ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838 ) can work with this. drag-and-do features of it will be more useful. Informational Tab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4930 ) also works. With the Multiple Tab Handler, Firefox becomes like old Firefox powered by TBE.\n\nIf you don't want that Tree Style Tab automatically builds the tree of tabs, you should disable \"extensions.treestyletab.autoAttachNewTabsAsChildren\" by about:config.
